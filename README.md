# SurvivalGame

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

# Note:
 
Marketplace content, addons, packages, and other premade content was moved to Content/Packages/ and ignored. However, ".keep" text files were added to keep the outer-most folder of each external library in the repo, sometimes with extra instructions. That content must be manually added/migrated to the project before it can fully function.
